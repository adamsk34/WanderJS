# TODO
* Document outlining branching
* Write a README
* Write a LICENSE (GPLv3)
* Decide how others can ontribute to the project
* Vision statement
    * Define scope, if people ask for something I can say that is out of scope
    * Get the entire content of a Wikipedia article in a JSON
        * Ideally, users should be able to specify which fields they care about so they don't get too much data
* Answer the question "Who is the user?"
* Note that this is only officially supported for English Wikipedia but I want to change that with the help of others
