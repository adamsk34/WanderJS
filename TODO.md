# TODO

-   Document outlining branching
-   Come up with a better name (!!!)
-   Decide how others can contribute to the project
-   Decide how to write tests (mocha)
-   Say in README how many similar projects exist, but this one is different because it is small
-   Document tools used (yarn, node)
-   Vision statement
    -   Define scope, if people ask for something I can say that is out of scope
    -   Get the entire content of a Wikipedia article in a JSON
        -   Ideally, users should be able to specify which fields they care about so they don't get too much data
-   Answer the question "Who is the user?"
-   Note that this is only officially supported for English Wikipedia but I want to change that with the help of others
