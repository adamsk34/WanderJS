# TODO

-   Use Eslint
-   Document outlining branching standards
-   There should be a class that holds the data for the article that can output more complicated stuff than merely JSON
    -   Test with TDD
-   Convert wikitext to human-readable JSON (look for existing module)
-   Decide how others can contribute to the project
-   Decide how to write tests (mocha)
-   Say in README how many similar projects exist, but this one is different because it is small
-   Write better documentation about tools used
-   Create CI pipeline
-   Vision statement
    -   Define scope, if people ask for something I can say that is out of scope
    -   Get the entire content of a Wikipedia article in a JSON
        -   Ideally, users should be able to specify which fields they care about so they don't get too much data
-   Answer the question "Who is the user?"
-   Note that this is only officially supported for English Wikipedia but I want to change that with the help of others
